# Defold - PCG Random

PCG Random Number Generator Native Extension for the Defold Game Engine

This extension allow you to generate random numbers using minimal [C implementation of PCG](http://www.pcg-random.org/using-pcg-c-basic.html).

It uses [entropy](https://github.com/imneme/pcg-c/blob/master/extras/entropy.c) seed internally with fallback to time based seed. You can switch to Time based seed and remove the entropy by uncommenting/commenting a few lines on the source code, but I don't think it is necessary. 

## Installation
You can use PCG Random in your own project by adding this project as a [Defold library dependency](http://www.defold.com/manuals/libraries/). Open your game.project file and in the dependencies field under project add:

## Usage

### rnd.seed(`init_state`, `init_seq`)

Seeds the random number generator.   
Random number generator is always initialized by using entropy seed. You don't need to call this method unless you want to control the seed.


`init_state` is the starting state for the RNG, you can pass any 64-bit value.  
`init_seq` selects the output sequence for the RNG, you can pass any 64-bit value, although only the low 63 bits are significant.
 
**Caution:** I don't recommend using of 64-bit integers. Consider using 32-bit integers instead. 

### rnd.seed()

Re-seed the random number generator by using entropy seed.  
Random number generator is always initialized by using entropy seed. You donâ€™t need to call this method unless you want to re-seed.

### rnd.number()

Returns a 32 bit unsigned integer.

### rnd.range(`min`, `max`)

Returns a 32 bit unsigned integer between min and max values. Only for positive numbers(unsigned integers).   
Same as **math.random(3,20)**  
**math.random(90)** == rnd.range(1, 90)

###  rnd.double()

Returns a floating point between 0-1.  
Same as **math.random()**

###  rnd.double_range(`min`, `max`)

Returns a floating point between min - max.  
Not fast as `rnd.double()`

###  rnd.toss()

Toss a coin. Returns 0 or 1 (0 = 'H', 1 = 'T')

###  rnd.roll()

Roll the dice. Returns between 1-6

###  rnd.check()

Testing entropy.



## Release Notes
